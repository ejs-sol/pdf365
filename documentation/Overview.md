## About the Portable Document Format (PDF)

The Portable Document Format (PDF), developed by Adobe in 1992, is a file format designed to present documents consistently across various software, hardware, and operating systems. Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout document, including text, fonts, graphics, and other information needed for display. This self-contained nature ensures that PDFs maintain their intended formatting regardless of where they are viewed or printed.
